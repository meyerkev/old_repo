/* Notes:
1. The messages are classified by which module's .cpp file prints them out.
You must follow this classification to be sure your modules behave like mine.
Note that p2_main does all printing except for when data about individual Persons, 
Meetings, or Rooms needs to be done by their output functions.

2. Where two strings appear in a row, they are part of the same message. 

3. If there is no actual constant non-whitespace text involved in an output statement, it
is not shown here. For example, the output statement for printing a Person's data just
outputs the data with one space between each item.

4. All error messages are actually printed out by p2_main. The unrecognized command error 
message can be printed out directly by p2_main if desired. But all other error messages are
used to initialize an Error exception object in the responsible module named below, and are
then printed out by the top-level catch block in p2_main.
