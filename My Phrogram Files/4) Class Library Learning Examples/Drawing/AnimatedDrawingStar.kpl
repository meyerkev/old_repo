Program AnimatedDrawingStar

	// Difficulty: Beginner
	// Concepts: Pen drawing, (X,Y) coordinates
	// Lines of KPL: Around 40
	// Author: Jon Schwartz

	// A teacher asked us about a way to delay drawing with the 
	// pen, so his students could see it happen in animated fashion.
	// We'll add that as a optional feature with the pen in KPL v 2
	// I think, because animated drawing is just fundamentally cool
	// to watch.  This is the second and more advanced example, 
	// using a star instead of a square, and thus having more 
	// interesting line slopes which must be drawn.  Basically, you 
	// can draw in small steps, and delay between each step.  This 
	// is more work than simply picking end points, but it does work.  
	// And an advantage of working with an example like this is that
	// kids really WILL have an intimate understanding of (X,Y)
	// coordinates and of looping when they understand this 
	// example.  Using diagonals is tricky, as X and Y both change
	// during a draw, but that also has the advantage of getting
	// them ready for geometry, and the slope of a line.

		Note that you can use block commenting to see an 
		example like this draw only one line at a time.  Try 
		this by putting the symbols above and below this
		comment block also on lines 55 and lines 83 below.
		This will "comment out" all lines between the
		symbols, so that KPL will not actually draw those 
		lines yet.  The symbol on line 35 always begins a
		comment block, and the symbol on line 47 always
		ends one.  When you are ready to see the second line
		of the star draw, you can move the begin comment 
		block symbol from line 55 to line 62, and so on.
