<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for downloading this release of the Java<SUP><FONT 
  size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> 2 Platform Standard Edition Development Kit 
  (JDK<SUP><FONT size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>). The JDK is a development environment 
  for building applications, applets, and components using the Java programming 
  language. 
  <P>The JDK includes tools useful for developing and testing programs written 
  in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform. These tools 
  are designed to be used from the command line. Except for the appletviewer, 
  these tools do not provide a graphical user interface.

<H2>Compatibility</H2></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>See <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/compatibility.html">Compatibility with 
  Previous Releases</A> on the Java Software web site for the list of known 
  compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to support programs written 
  for previous versions of the Java platform. Although some incompatible changes 
  were necessary, most software should migrate to the current version with no 
  reprogramming. Any failure to do so is considered a bug, except for a small 
  number of cases where compatibility was deliberately broken, as described on 
  our compatibility web page. Some compatibility-breaking changes were required 
  to close potential security holes or to fix implementation or design bugs.

<H2>The J2SE Runtime Environment</H2></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The J2SE Runtime Environment is available as a separately 
  downloadable product. See the <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.html">download web site</A>. 
  <P>The J2SE Runtime Environment allows you to run applications written in the 
  Java programming language. Like the JDK, it contains the Java virtual machine, 
  classes comprising the Java 2 Platform API, and supporting files. Unlike the 
  JDK, it does not contain development tools such as compilers and debuggers. 
  <P>You can freely redistribute the J2SE Runtime Environment with your 
  application, according to the terms of the Runtime Environment's license. Once 
  you have developed your application using the JDK, you can ship it with the 
  Runtime Environment so your end-users will have a Java platform on which to 
  run your software. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=redistribution>

  <H3>Redistributable JDK Files</H3>The limited set of files from the JDK listed 
  below may be included in vendor redistributions of the J2SE Runtime 
  Environment. They cannot be redistributed separately, and must accompany a JRE 
  distribution. All paths are relative to the top-level directory of the JDK. 
  <DL>
    <DT><TT>jre/lib/cmm/PYCC.pf</TT> 
    <DD>Color profile. This file is required only if one wishes to convert 
    between the PYCC color space and another color space. 
    <DT>All <TT>.ttf</TT> font files in the <TT>jre/lib/fonts</TT> directory. 
    <DD>Note that the LucidaSansRegular.ttf font is already contained in the 
    J2SE Runtime Environment, so there is no need to bring that file over from 
    the JDK. 
    <DT><TT>jre/lib/audio/soundbank.gm</TT> 
    <DD>This MIDI soundbank is present in the JDK, but it has been removed from 
    the J2SE Runtime Environment in order to reduce the size of the Runtime 
    Environment's download bundle. However, a soundbank file is necessary for 
    MIDI playback, and therefore the JDK's <TT>soundbank.gm</TT> file may be 
    included in redistributions of the Runtime Environment at the vendor's 
    discretion. Several versions of enhanced MIDI soundbanks are available from 
    the Java Sound web site: <A 
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/">http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/</A>. 
    These alternative soundbanks may be included in redistributions of the J2SE 
    Runtime Environment. 
    <DT>The javac bytecode compiler, consisting of the following files: 
    <DD><TT>bin/javac</TT> [Solaris(TM) Operating System and 
    Linux]<BR><TT>bin/sparcv9/javac</TT> [Solaris Operating System (SPARC(R) 
    Platform Edition)]<BR><TT>bin/amd64/javac</TT> [Solaris Operating System 
    (AMD)]<BR><TT>bin/javac.exe</TT> [Microsoft 
    Windows]<BR><TT>lib/tools.jar</TT> [All platforms] 
    <DT>The Annotation Processing Tool, consisting of the following files:<BR>
    <DD><TT>bin/apt</TT> [Solaris(TM) Operating System and 
    Linux]<BR><TT>bin/sparcv9/apt</TT> [Solaris Operating System (SPARC(R) 
    Platform Edition)]<BR><TT>bin/amd64/apt</TT> [Solaris Operating System 
    (AMD)]<BR><TT>bin/apt.exe</TT> [Microsoft Windows] 
    <DT><TT>jre\bin\server\</TT> 
    <DD>On Microsoft Windows platforms, the JDK includes both the Java HotSpot 
    Server VM and Java HotSpot Client VM. However, the J2SE Runtime Environment 
    for Microsoft Windows platforms includes only the Java HotSpot Client VM. 
    Those wishing to use the Java HotSpot Server VM with the J2SE Runtime 
    Environment may copy the JDK's <TT>jre\bin\server</TT> folder to a 
    <TT>bin\server</TT> directory in the J2SE Runtime Environment. Software 
    vendors may redistribute the Java HotSpot Server VM with their 
    redistributions of the J2SE Runtime Environment. </DD></DL>
  <H3>Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension</H3>Due to import control 
  restrictions for some countries, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy 
  files shipped with the J2SE Development Kit and the J2SE Runtime Environment 
  allow strong but limited cryptography to be used. These files are located at 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/local_policy.jar
&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>where <TT>&lt;java-home&gt;</TT> is the <TT>jre</TT> 
  directory of the JDK or the top-level directory of the J2SE Runtime 
  Environment. 
  <P>An unlimited strength version of these files indicating no restrictions on 
  cryptographic strengths is available on the JDK web site for those living in 
  eligible countries. Those living in eligible countries may download the 
  unlimited strength version and replace the strong cryptography jar files with 
  the unlimited strength files. 
  <H3>jconsole</H3>
  <DL>
    <DT><TT>jconsole.jar</TT> 
    <DD>jconsole may be redistributed outside the JDK but only with Sun's JRE. 
    </DD></DL>
  <H3>Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism</H3>An endorsed standard is a Java 
  API defined through a standards process other than the Java Community 
  Process<SUP><FONT size=-1>SM</FONT></SUP> (JCP<SUP><FONT 
  size=-1>SM</FONT></SUP>). Because endorsed standards are defined outside the 
  JCP, it is anticipated that such standards will be revised between releases of 
  the Java 2 Platform. In order to take advantage of new revisions to endorsed 
  standards, developers and software vendors may use the Endorsed Standards 
  Override Mechanism to provide newer versions of an endorsed standard than 
  those included in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun Microsystems. 
  <P>For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism, 
  including the list of platform packages that it may be used to override, see 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><A 
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/index.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/standards/index.html</A> 
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Classes in the packages listed on that web page may be replaced only by 
  classes implementing a more recent version of the API as defined by the 
  appropriate standards body. 
  <P>In addition to the packages listed in the document at the above URL, which 
  are part of the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition (J2SE<SUP><FONT 
  size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>) specification, redistributors of Sun's J2SE Reference 
  Implementation are allowed to override classes whose sole purpose is to 
  implement the functionality provided by public APIs defined in these Endorsed 
  Standards packages. Redistributors may also override classes in the 
  <TT>org.w3c.dom.*</TT> packages, or other classes whose sole purpose is to 
  implement these APIs. 
  <H3>The cacerts Certificates File<BR></H3>Root CA certificates may be added to 
  or removed from the J2SE certificate file located at 
  <CODE>&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security/cacerts</CODE>. For more information, see
